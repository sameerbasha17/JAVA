// By Default the java.lang package is imported
// Every Java program must have a class
// The file name must be same as the class name
// The main method is the entry point of any Java program

public class MyFirst{                                  // class name is MyFirst
    public static void main(String [] args){           // main method     
        System.out.println("Hello, Sameer!");        // printing a string to the console   
    }
}

 3. Class names should be unique
 4. If a class is public, the file name must be the same as the class name
 5. If a class is not public, it can have any name
 6. A Java program can have multiple classes, but only one public class */
